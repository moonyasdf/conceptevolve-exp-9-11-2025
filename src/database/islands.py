"""Island management utilities for the evolutionary database layer.

The island model partitions the concept population into semi-isolated subgroups
that occasionally exchange migrants.  This module is responsible for assigning
new concepts to islands and orchestrating migrations according to the configured
policy parameters:

* ``num_islands`` controls the number of available subpopulations.
* ``migration_rate`` dictates what fraction of each island's population crosses
  over during a migration event.
* ``island_elitism`` optionally protects the top concept when selecting
  migrants.

Assignments favour inheriting the parent's island to preserve lineage cohesion
while migrations use stochastic destinations to encourage cross-island mixing.
